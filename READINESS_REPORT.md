# Spinr Project - Comprehensive Readiness Analysis

## Executive Summary

Based on my thorough analysis of the entire Spinr project, **the code is NOT yet ready for testing/sharing APKs**. There are several critical issues, missing configurations, and incomplete features that need to be addressed before the apps can be considered production-ready.

---

## Project Components Analyzed

| Component | Technology | Status |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Backend | FastAPI (Python) + Supabase | ⚠️ Needs Configuration |
| Driver App | Expo/React Native | ⚠️ Needs Testing |
| Rider App | Expo/React Native | ⚠️ Needs Testing |
| Admin Dashboard | Next.js | ⚠️ Needs Auth |
| Frontend Web | Expo Router Web | ⚠️ Needs Testing |

## 🚨 Top-Priority Action: Rotate Leaked Credentials

The following real-looking credentials were found committed to this repository
on 2026-04-11. **Rotate them in the respective provider consoles before any
further deployment**, and consider using `git filter-repo` (or BFG) if the
history needs to be scrubbed on a rewritten branch.

| Credential | Found In | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Supabase **service-role** JWT (project `dbbadhihiwztmnqnbdke`) | `backend/.env.example` (now sanitized) | Revoke & regenerate in Supabase → Settings → API |
| Google Maps API key `AIzaSy…M5m9M` | `rider-app/eas.json`, `driver-app/eas.json` | Delete key in Google Cloud Console → APIs & Services → Credentials, create a new restricted key |

The repo now ships sanitized `.env.example` files in `backend/`, `rider-app/`,
`driver-app/`, and `admin-dashboard/`. Copy each to `.env` (or `.env.local`
for admin) and fill in values locally.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Release)

### 1. Missing Environment Variables

**Critical** - The following environment variables are not configured:

```
Backend (.env):
- SUPABASE_URL=your-project.supabase.co
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-key
- JWT_SECRET=your-strong-secret-key
- FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=your-json
- TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your-sid
- TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_xxx

Driver/Rider Apps (.env):
- EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://your-backend-url
- EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-maps-key
- EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-key
```

### 2. Firebase Not Configured

In [`spinr/shared/config/spinr.config.ts:92`](spinr/shared/config/spinr.config.ts:92):
```typescript
firebase: {
  enabled: false, // Set to true when Firebase is configured
  // All fields empty
}
```

This affects authentication and push notifications.

### 3. Twilio Not Configured

In [`spinr/shared/config/spinr.config.ts:105`](spinr/shared/config/spinr.config.ts:105):
```typescript
twilio: {
  enabled: false, // Set to true when Twilio is configured
}
```

This affects SMS OTP functionality.

### 4. Admin Dashboard Has No Authentication — ✅ RESOLVED

Previously, `/dashboard` had no login protection. Resolution (2026-04-12):

- **Edge middleware** at `admin-dashboard/src/middleware.ts` redirects
  any non-public request without an `admin_token` cookie to
  `/login?next=<original>`. Public paths: `/login`, `/register/*`,
  `/track/*`, Next internals, static assets.
- **Cookie bridge**: `authStore.setToken` dual-writes the JWT to
  localStorage (for React + `api.ts`) and to the `admin_token`
  cookie (for the edge middleware). `logout` clears both.
- **Backend endpoints already existed** (`POST /api/admin/auth/login`,
  `GET /api/admin/auth/session`, `POST /api/admin/auth/logout` in
  `backend/routes/admin/auth.py`) — the gap was purely the Next.js
  middleware.

### 5. CORS Allows All Origins — ✅ RESOLVED

Previously `core/config.py` defaulted `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to `"*"`, making a
fresh deploy wide-open. As of 2026-04-11:

- The default in `core/config.py` is now
  `"http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:8081,http://localhost:19006"`
  (Expo dev + admin dashboard).
- `core/middleware.py` **fail-fast-refuses to start** if `ENV=production`
  and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` still contains `"*"` (raises `RuntimeError`).
- When `"*"` is present in dev, `allow_credentials` is forced to `False`
  (the CORS spec forbids wildcard + credentials anyway), and a warning
  is logged.

Override in each environment's `.env` with a comma-separated list of
allowed origins, e.g. `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://spinr.ca,https://admin.spinr.ca`.

## Missing Features & Broken Links

### A. Database Schema Setup — Bootstrap Sequence

A schema-drift audit on 2026-04-11 produced the following findings:

**Do NOT use `backend/FINAL_SCHEMA.sql`** — it's abandoned/incomplete. It uses
`UUID` primary keys while the application code expects `TEXT` ids, omits
`document_requirements`, `driver_documents`, `corporate_accounts`,
`emergency_contacts`, `area_fees`, `payouts`, `bank_accounts`, and defines
`find_nearby_drivers` twice (lines 159–188 and 249–278). Treat this file as
deprecated and ignore it when standing up a fresh project.

**Canonical apply order for a fresh Supabase project:**

1. Run `backend/supabase_schema.sql` (core tables, `uuid-ossp`,
   `find_nearby_drivers`, `update_driver_location`)
2. Run `backend/sql/01_postgis_schema.sql` _(optional — only needed if you
   plan to use PostGIS queries; current code uses haversine math, so you can
   skip this)_
3. Run `backend/sql/02_add_updated_at.sql`
4. Run `backend/sql/03_features.sql` (tax/surge/airport fee columns,
   subscription/dispute tables)
5. Run `backend/sql/04_rides_admin_overhaul.sql` — **REQUIRED**. Creates
   `flags`, `complaints`, `lost_and_found`, and `driver_location_history`,
   which are referenced by code (`db_supabase.py`) but are NOT in
   `supabase_schema.sql`. Skipping this will produce table-not-found errors.
6. Apply `backend/migrations/*.sql` via the runner (preferred):
   ```bash
   export DATABASE_URL='postgres://…pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres'
   python -m backend.scripts.run_migrations --status   # inspect state
   python -m backend.scripts.run_migrations            # apply pending
   ```
   The runner uses the `schema_migrations` tracking table (migration 24)
   so re-runs are safe. See `backend/migrations/README.md` for the
   naming convention. Historical note: `10_disputes_table.sql` runs
   before `10b_service_area_driver_matching.sql` (renamed from
   `10_service_area_driver_matching.sql`), and `23_profile_image_url.sql`
   was formerly `add_profile_image_url.sql`. Migration 17
   (`17_corporate_accounts_fk.sql`) adds the FK constraints that link
   `users.corporate_account_id` / `rides.corporate_account_id` to
   `corporate_accounts.id` and enables RLS on the corporate_accounts table.
7. Run `backend/supabase_rls.sql` last to enable RLS policies.

**Resolved drift (2026-04-11):**

- ✅ **`corporate_accounts` triple-definition** — Previously defined in three
  places with conflicting shapes. Resolution:
  `migrations/05_corporate_accounts.sql` is now the single source of truth
  (UUID id, `name`, `credit_limit` — matches `routes/corporate_accounts.py`
  Pydantic models); `migrations/03_corporate_accounts_heatmap.sql` has been
  gutted of its conflicting CREATE TABLE / seed / RLS (it now only adds
  heat-map settings columns and the UUID FK-link columns on users/rides,
  without the REFERENCES clauses); `backend/corporate_accounts_schema.sql`
  has been deleted; and `migrations/17_corporate_accounts_fk.sql` adds the
  FK constraints and RLS policy after 05 creates the table.
- ✅ **Dead `exec_sql` plumbing** — `execute_query`/`execute_write` in
  `db_supabase.py` and their callers in `db.py` (`fetchall`, `fetchone`,
  `execute`) have been deleted. They had zero callers in the codebase and
  referenced an undefined Supabase RPC (`exec_sql`).

**Remaining drift / gotchas:**

- **PostGIS is not required by current code**. `find_nearby_drivers` in
  `supabase_schema.sql:323` uses haversine math, not `ST_Distance`. PostGIS
  only becomes mandatory if future work adopts geography columns.
- **Duplicate `status` column on `users`/`drivers`**: added by both
  `sql/04_rides_admin_overhaul.sql` and `migrations/12_driver_lifecycle_status.sql`.
  No runtime conflict thanks to `IF NOT EXISTS`, but clean this up before
  it bites someone.

### B. Missing Legal Content

The Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are **empty strings** by default:
- [`spinr/backend/schemas.py:62`](spinr/backend/schemas.py:62): `terms_of_service_text: str = ""`
- [`spinr/backend/schemas.py:63`](spinr/backend/schemas.py:63): `privacy_policy_text: str = ""`

These need to be set in the database settings.

### C. Legal Pages Not Linked Properly — ✅ RESOLVED

Previously flagged: legal pages referenced `SpinrConfig.api.baseUrl`, which
does not exist. Verified on 2026-04-11 — both
[`rider-app/app/legal.tsx:33`](rider-app/app/legal.tsx:33) and
[`driver-app/app/legal.tsx:33`](driver-app/app/legal.tsx:33) now use
`SpinrConfig.backendUrl`. No code change needed.

### D. Missing Google Maps API Key

In [`spinr/driver-app/app/_layout.tsx:33`](spinr/driver-app/app/_layout.tsx:33):
```typescript
script.src = `https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=${process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}&libraries=places`;
```

This will fail without proper API key configuration.

### E. Missing API Base URL Configuration — ✅ RESOLVED
See §C above. Both legal screens now call `${SpinrConfig.backendUrl}/settings/legal`.

---

## Flow Issues

### 1. Driver App Ride Flow

The driver app has a proper state machine in [`spinr/driver-app/store/driverStore.ts`](spinr/driver-app/store/driverStore.ts):
```
idle → ride_offered → navigating_to_pickup → 
arrived_at_pickup → trip_in_progress → trip_completed
```

However, WebSocket connection for real-time ride offers may not be fully implemented in the store.

### 2. Rider App Ride Flow

Complete flow exists:
1. Login → OTP → Profile Setup
2. Home (Map) → Search Destination
3. Ride Options → Payment Confirm
4. Ride Status → Driver Arriving → In Progress → Completed
5. Rate Ride

### 3. Admin Dashboard Missing Features

- No authentication/login page (security issue)
- Settings page exists at [`spinr/admin-dashboard/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`](spinr/admin-dashboard/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx) but needs proper API integration

---

## Configuration Issues

### 1. Backend URL Configuration

In [`spinr/shared/config/index.ts:17`](spinr/shared/config/index.ts:17):
```typescript
return 'https://spinr-backend.onrender.com';  // Hardcoded fallback
```

This will fail if not configured properly.

### 2. Duplicate Config Files

- [`spinr/shared/config/spinr.config.ts`](spinr/shared/config/spinr.config.ts) - has `backendUrl` getter
- [`spinr/shared/config/index.ts`](spinr/shared/config/index.ts) - has separate `API_URL` export
- This causes confusion and potential mismatches

---

## Testing Status

### Backend Tests
- Only basic smoke tests exist: [`spinr/backend/tests_smoke_supabase.py`](spinr/backend/tests_smoke_supabase.py)
- No unit tests for API endpoints
- No integration tests

### Mobile Apps
- **NO TEST FILES** found for either driver or rider apps
- No unit tests
- No integration tests

### Admin Dashboard
- **NO TEST FILES** found
