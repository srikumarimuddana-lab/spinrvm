--
-- BUGFIX: purge_pii_retention() Step F referenced stripe_events.created_at,
-- but that column does not exist on production. Migration 22's CREATE TABLE
-- defined stripe_events with `received_at` (and `processed_at`), not
-- `created_at`. Same root cause and failure mode as migrations 187
-- (driver_location_history Step C) and 323 (ride_messages Step D, applied
-- moments before this one, same session) -- confirmed live 2026-08-17 via a
-- purge_pii_retention(true) dry-run call immediately after applying 323:
--     ERROR: 42703: column "created_at" does not exist
--     QUERY: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM stripe_events WHERE created_at < ...
--     CONTEXT: PL/pgSQL function purge_pii_retention(boolean) line 114
--
-- A live column-existence sweep against every table/column
-- purge_pii_retention() references (run right after this failure, before
-- writing this migration) confirmed this is the LAST remaining broken
-- reference -- every other step's columns (rides, driver_location_history,
-- ride_messages, refresh_tokens, audit_logs, users, drivers,
-- driver_insurance_periods, payouts, bank_accounts, financial_events,
-- saved_addresses, support_tickets, reconciliation_discrepancies,
-- ride_routes, ai_messages, ai_conversations, surge_pricing,
-- price_searches, compliance_export_events) all exist as the function
-- expects. Step F was the third and final instance of this bug class.
--
-- Impact: with 323 applied but this not yet applied, the function's Steps
-- A-D-through-E now complete, but Step F still aborts the whole function
-- (same all-or-nothing plpgsql transaction semantics as 187/323's headers
-- describe) -- so Steps F through N (stripe_events cleanup, audit_logs,
-- Step H's DSAR account hard-delete, ride-route GPS clearing, AI chat,
-- surge history, price_searches, compliance_export_events, profile-scrub)
-- still never ran to completion until this migration lands.
--
-- FIX: re-fork purge_pii_retention VERBATIM from migration 323 (the
-- current, just-applied version with the Step D fix) and change ONLY Step
-- F's stripe_events column reference from `created_at` to `received_at`.
-- Nothing else changes -- Step D's ride_messages.timestamp fix (323) and
-- Step H's A38 driver-ride guard (321) are both preserved unchanged.
--
-- No new index needed: stripe_events already has no index on `received_at`
-- either (checked live), but this table's 90-day retention window and
-- Spinr's current low-tens-of-thousands row count (per migration 50's own
-- scale note) make a seq scan here cheap, same reasoning migration 50
-- applied to the other small tables it didn't index. Revisit if
-- stripe_events grows enough for this to matter.
--
-- Forward-compatible: CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION only, no schema change, no
-- data mutation, no lock beyond what the existing 03:00 UTC loop already
-- takes under its Redis leader lock. First successful run will clear the
-- backlog of every step's overdue rows in one pass.
--
-- Rollback:
--   Re-apply migration 323's purge_pii_retention definition verbatim
--   (reverts Step F's `received_at` reference back to the broken
--   `created_at`).

Step B (7y rides) relies on financial_events_ride_id_fkey ON DELETE SET NULL (294/295). Step C uses driver_location_history.received_at (187). Step D uses ride_messages.timestamp, not created_at (323). Step F uses stripe_events.received_at, not created_at (324). Step H (216, driver-ride guard added by A38/321) HARD-DELETES DSAR-deleted accounts at 7y with NO anonymization once their regulatory footprint (rides as rider OR driver, driver_insurance_periods, payouts, bank_accounts) has cleared. Step N (296) scrubs profile PII (name/email/profile_image/saved_addresses) 30 days after a DSAR deletion request, independent of Step H''s 7y window, per regulatory-sk.md Right-to-delete #1. p_dry_run=true returns counts without mutating.';
